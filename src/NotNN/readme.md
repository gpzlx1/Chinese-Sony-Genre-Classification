To get the performence of different models, remove the comments for them in `demo.py`

```python
# line 142
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # NB_predict() # Naive Bayes with tokens
    # RF_predict() # Random Forests with tokens
    # LR_predict() # Logistic Regression with tokens
    # NB_predict_word()
    # RF_predict_word()
    # LR_predict_word()
    pass
```
and run
```shell
cd $PROJECT_ROOT

python3 src/NN/demo.py
```
